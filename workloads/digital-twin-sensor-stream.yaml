# Digital Twin Sensor Data Stream Test
# Simulates high-frequency sensor data from manufacturing equipment

name: Digital Twin Sensor Stream Test / 10K sensors @ 1Hz
description: "Simulates 10,000 sensors sending data every second (typical IoT scenario)"

# Topology optimized for Digital Twin
topics: 10                          # Separate topics for different sensor types
partitionsPerTopic: 16              # High partition count for parallel processing
keyDistributor: "ROUND_ROBIN"       # Distribute sensors across partitions

# Message characteristics typical of IoT sensor data
messageSize: 512                    # 512 bytes - typical for sensor telemetry with metadata
payloadFile: null                   # Will use generated sensor-like data

# Producer configuration for sensor simulation
producersPerTopic: 10               # 100 total producers (10 per topic)
producerRate: 1000                  # 1000 messages/sec per producer = 10K total msg/s

# Consumer configuration for real-time processing
subscriptionsPerTopic: 2            # 2 consumer groups per topic (e.g., storage + analytics)
consumerPerSubscription: 4          # 4 consumers per group for parallel processing
consumerBacklogSizeGB: 0            # Real-time processing, no backlog

# Test duration optimized for Digital Twin validation
testDurationMinutes: 10             # 10 minutes sustained test
warmupDurationMinutes: 2            # 2 minutes warmup for connection establishment
